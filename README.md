# Mr-Mannequins-Tools
Currently just the Python of an add-on for Blender 2.8+ that enables loading, saving and export of animations and character meshes to UE4 without the need for re-targeting within Unreal Engine.

If you want to know how this works, see [Mannequin Compatibility Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRoQ3T8chUg&list=PL1VT6HxCKabeKxASV_HUrt3mtn3ld6sa0&index=3).

These files will NOT work without the companion *MMT_Stash* folder!

If you download and/or edit these scripts from here you would need to extract the *MMT_Stash* folder from the add-on as it is on Gumroad and zip it back up with the code from here.

I need to figure out licencing before I can upload the *MMT_Stash* files here. All the Python comes under the GNU GPL v3, but the contents of the stash folder do not.
