# Mr-Mannequins-Tools
Currently just the Python of an add-on for Blender 2.8+ that enables loading, saving and export of animations and character meshes to UE4 without the need for re-targeting within Unreal Engine.

These files will NOT work without the companion "MMT_Stash" folder!

If you download and/or edit these scripts from here you would need to extract the "MMT_Stash" folder from the add-on as it is on Gumroad and zip it back up with the code from here.

I need to figure out licencing before i can upload the "MMT_Stash" here. All the Python comes under the GNU, but the contents of the stash folder do not.
