# Mr Mannequins Tools

Mr Mannequins Tools is a [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on that exports animations and weighted meshes that are directly compatible with the
third person mannequin that is available in [Unreal Engine's Third Person Template](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Resources/Templates/ThirdPerson/index.html),
without re-targeting anything in Unreal Engine.

Features:

- Animation ready mannequin rig with IK and other various rigging features
- Animation ready first person gun rig (more rigging features coming soon)
- Accurate Blender version of the mannequin and gun materials
- Mannequin and gun mesh LODs
- Basic pose interface with some useful rigging options
- 90% accurate animation import and conversion script, still working on the performance heavy 100% version
- The mother of all FBX export scripts

Plenty more to come including advanced mutilation rigging options, a female mannequin amongst other meshes, an improved pose mode interface and more options for everything.

If you want to know how this works, see [Mannequin Compatibility Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRoQ3T8chUg&list=PL1VT6HxCKabeKxASV_HUrt3mtn3ld6sa0&index=3).
